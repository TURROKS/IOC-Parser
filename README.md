# IOC-Parser

IOC-Parser would allow you to extract the most common IOC types from text files, including 

* IPs
* File Names
* Emails
* Hashes
* URLs
* Domains 

*Note: Please note that the Domais extracted would be based on the URLs present on the text as individual domains might be extracted as File Names since the regex used would match file names first*

Enjoy the tool and Stay Safe!
